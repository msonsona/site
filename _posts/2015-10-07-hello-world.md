excerpt: In which the author presents the blog

Hi! I'm starting a new blog!

Using the famous `Hello World!` title for the first post of the blog sure it's not original at all, but it's an established tradition for programmers starting with a new programming language, so it's usually also a tradition for programmer-bloggers starting a programming blog.

In this blog I'll write down the things I learn while coding new stuff, making new prototypes or following (programming) courses. Some of my interests are artificial intelligence, game development, the intersection between art and technology, sports and data, so expect the posts to cover these or mixing some of them too.

You can subscribe using this [link]({{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) so you won't miss a new post!
